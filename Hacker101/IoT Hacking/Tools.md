- Multimeter - Measure electricity
	- Pins slots: 
		- COM - for ground wire - black probe
		- 500V (= 200 mA) or 10A = Power Source = Red Probe
		- V -> Volts, mA -> miliAmps, A -> Amps
	- Measuring dial
		- Direct current (DC) voltage
		- Alternate current (AC) voltage
		- Resistance
		- Continuity test
		- BATT - battery test, `red probe` on positive side of battery, `black probe` on negative side
		- Amps - low but safe, large but unsafe
-   TTL to USB
	- TTL - Transistor-Transistor logic, bipolar transistors act of direct current pulse.
	- Used to connect UART to USB
- [Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate) 
	- Can be used to connect UART to USB, JTag to USB, SOIC chip to USB for firmware dumping
- terminal multiplexers: 
	- `sudo screen <TTYID> <Baud Rate>`, Eg. `sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`. Once the shell is opened
	- PuTTy
- [JTAGUlator](https://grandideastudio.com/portfolio/security/jtagulator/) On-chip debug interface, [sorce code](https://github.com/grandideastudio/jtagulator). Useful to identify different PINs on a board
- [Attify Badge](https://www.attify-store.com/products/attify-badge-uart-jtag-spi-i2c) Similar to Bus pirate with extra PINs
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - small microprocessor for experiments. Code examples:
