- Principle - `seek`, `act`, `print`
- Open in radare2: `r2 <binary>`
- `eco` - select color scheme

- Help
	- `i?` : help for info module
	- `d?`: help info for debug module
	- `a?`: help info for analyze module
	- `~?`: search pattern help info
	- `/?`: search help info
- `V`  Toggle to binary View mode. 
	- `p`: switch between different views, select next view in sequence
	- `P`: switch between different views, select previous view in sequence
	- `j`, `k`, arrow keys: move up and down in the binary view. It also sets the current location for debugging
	- `<enter>`: if current line is a call to another function, follow that function address
	- `u`: jump back to the previous location from which the address was followed using `<enter>`
	- `;`: add a comment on the current seek position
	- `q` : exit the binary view mode
- Analysis
	- `aaa` - analyze the binary
	- `afl` - Analyze function list
	- `afl~<searchstring>` : filter the function list that matches the search string
	- `/ad/ xor ~ah` : search disassembly code for xor instruction with `ah` in it
	- `iS~[5]` : Show column 5 (base 0) from the results
	- `aar` - analyze address references (instruction references)
	- `s main` - seek to `main` function (jump to the address)
	- `axt` : analyze cross references to. Search all the locations where current function is called.
	- `axf` : analyze cross references from.
- Info
	- `ii` - info about imports
	- `iI` - binary info
	- `iS` - sections
	- `is` - symbols
	- `iz` - strings
	- `iS entropy`: get entropy of different sections. High entropy typically means packed binary
- Binary Info
	- `rabin2 -a arch -b bits -i <binary>` show binary info  for given architecture and bit size
	- `rabin2 -g <binary>` show all possible information
	- `rabin2 -l <binary>` show linked libraries
	- `rabin2 -z <binary>` show strings in data section
	- `rafind2 -z` : find zero terminated strings
	- `rafind2 -s` : find specific string
	- `rafind2 -e` : find regular expression
	- `rafind2 -x` : find hex pairs
```sh
export F=/bin/ls
for a in `rafind2 -s libc $F`; do r2 -ns $a -qc 'x 32' $F; done
```
- Patching
	- `r2 -w <binary>` : open binary in write mode
	- `A` : Press `A` in view binary mode to start writing. Eg. `A` -> `mov rax, 0x1337` -> `<enter>`
	- `w?` : other write commands
- Debugging
	- `r2 -d -A <binary>` : Launch binary in debug mode, `-A` for auto analyze on launch
	- Side note: In view mode `:e stack.size = 256` to display the 256 bytes in stack view during debugging
	- Explore: tmux view for debugging
	- `F7` -> step into
	- `F8` -> step over
	- `ds?` -> all debug step instructions
	- `db <addr>` : add debug breakpoint on given address/symbol
	- `db`: show current breakpoints
	- `dc` : debug continue
	- `do`: open the process for debugging again. Start over
	- Press `.`  in view mode to go the current program instruction. Helpful when our seek pointer is different from program counter
	- `dsf`: finish current frame (function)
	- `pf S @ <addr>`:  print function symbol at given address
	- `afvd`: display local function variable declaration. `.afvd <symbol name>` print the value of given local variable 
	- `pd @ <addr>` - print disassembly at address, `pdf` prints disassembly of the function
	- `axt @ @ str.*` - print cross references to all the strings
	- `dr` - show general purpose registers
	- `dr 1` - flags in flags register
	- 
- Graph View:
	- `VV` to enter the graph view
	- `g<letter>` : these jump commands are visible on appropriate instructions where jump is possible
	-  `p`, `P` : switch to different display modes
	- `x` -> cross references to the function at current seek position
- Visual Panel:
	- in View mode: press `!` to open the visual panel mode
	- `"` on active window to change its settings
	- `-` horizontal split the current panel
	- `X` : close panel
	- `w`: switch to window mode to resize the panel
	- `t`: tab related actions
- Decompiler
	- install `r2ghidra`, run `r2pm update` -> `r2pm install r2ghidra`
	- Other useful plugins
		- `r2dec`
		- `r2frida`
	- `pdg` -> print decompiled function code
